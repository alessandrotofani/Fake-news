"""

Typical complex rows (extension .txtx as extended txt) are:

1@3 1 2 &if n==1:v=100#else:v=10& 3

or (with the same effect)

1@3 1 2 &if n==1:v=100#if n>1:v=10& 3

or

1@3 &v=100*n& 3

or

1@3 1 2 3

; is quite complicated to be used with if, so we use #

n and v are mandatory names
  n is the value in first position of the record
  v is the result of the calculation in a formula

& starts and concludes a formula

we can have more than one formula in a row
(but we can have more than a row)
